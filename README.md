# Decision Tree Classification using Python

This project demonstrates how **Decision Tree Classification** can be used to predict class labels by learning decision rules from data features. Decision Trees split the dataset into smaller, interpretable segments, making the model easy to visualize and understand.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To implement and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** that accurately predicts categorical outcomes by learning rule-based splits.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – data preprocessing and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualizations and tree plotting  
- **Scikit-learn** – Decision Tree implementation and evaluation  

---

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – inspect dataset structure  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – cleaning, encoding, scaling (if needed)  
3. **Model Training** – build a Decision Tree Classifier  
4. **Prediction** – classify test samples  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  
6. **Visualization** – decision tree plot and class boundaries  

---

## 📈 Results
The Decision Tree model successfully classifies data by creating clear decision rules. It is interpretable and performs well on datasets with non-linear patterns.

---

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- How **Decision Trees** split data using information gain or Gini impurity  
- Visualizing tree structures for interpretability  
- Risks of **overfitting** and the need for pruning or limiting tree depth  
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Apply **pruning techniques** to reduce overfitting  
- Compare performance with Random Forest Classifier  
- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
